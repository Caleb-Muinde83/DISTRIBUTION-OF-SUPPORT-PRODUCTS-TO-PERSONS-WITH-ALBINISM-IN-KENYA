## Description
In recent years, Kenya has made significant progress in ensuring the safety and well-being of persons with Albinism within the East African community. A notable milestone was the election of Isaac Mwaura, the first Kenyan with Albinism to join parliament in 2013. The Kenyan government has taken measures to improve the health standards of persons with Albinism, driven by recommendations from a 2017 research report.

The report highlighted critical issues, including limited access to healthcare, particularly medical checkups and sunscreen for persons with Albinism. Moreover, the government relied on unreliable estimates to distribute essential health products, potentially leaving a significant percentage of persons with Albinism underserved.

As part of its commitment to "leave no one behind" under the Vision 2030 initiative, the government recognized that persons with Albinism are among those furthest from adequate support. Unfortunately, they have been marginalized in discussions on gender, disability, and the unique challenges posed by their skin color, which intersects with their Albinism.

To address these issues, a comprehensive survey was conducted. Subsequently, on June 20, 2018, the government updated its data on the number of persons with Albinism to facilitate more equitable distribution of support products across counties and the entire country.

This project aims to derive insights that will optimize the distribution of sunscreen and support products to persons with Albinism, ensuring fairness and appropriateness in the allocation process.
